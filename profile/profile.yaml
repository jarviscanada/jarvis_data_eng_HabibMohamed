summary: "I was exposed to software development for the first time in high school when I took a Java-centric computer science class for an elective. I really enjoyed the problem-solving involved as well as the multitude of solutions one could come up with to a given problem. This solidified my decision to take computer science at the University
of Windsor. During my time as an undergraduate, I gained various experiences including being a teaching assistant for courses on Linux and the Internet, successfully developing a mobile version of a web client as a co-op student, presiding over Unity/C# labs, and developing interfaces to upload gigabytes of medical data, as well query for data
based on provided IDs as a research assistant. I graduated from the University of Windsor with distinction, obtaining a Honors Computer Science degree with software engineering specialization. I joined Jarvis as a data engineer, and am currently working on various projects. Some of the projects I have delivered includes a Linux cluster monitoring
agent, a proof-of-concept trading system, and a command line Tweet interface, amongst others. I am looking to further my expertise as a developer in my next position, and hit the ground running in terms of contribution with the skills and experiences I have gained throughout my journey so far."
